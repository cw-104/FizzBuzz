# Fizzbuzz

## What is this Project?

This program is my solution to the "FizzBuzz" problem. For every number from 1 to 100, the program prints out the number in the terminal. If the number is divisible by 3, it will instead print out "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, it will instead print out "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it will print out "FizzBuzz".
